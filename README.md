# Mini Task Submission: Option A + Option B

This repository contains both required implementations in separate folders:

- `option-a-webhook-receiver` -> Webhook Receiver + DB (FastAPI + SQLite + idempotency)
- `option-b-telegram-bot` -> Telegram Bot + Provider API (SQLite + optional Notion push)

## How to run
Each folder has its own:
- `README.md`
- `.env.example`
- `requirements.txt`

Open the folder you want and follow its README.
